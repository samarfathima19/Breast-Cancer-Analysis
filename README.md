🎗️ Breast Cancer Prediction App
A Streamlit-based web application designed to predict whether a breast tumor is Malignant or Benign using advanced machine learning techniques. Built to promote breast cancer awareness, this app employs an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for accurate and reliable predictions.

📝 Overview
This application offers:

Prediction Functionality: Users can input tumor characteristics to determine if the tumor is Malignant or Benign.
Interactive Design: A visually appealing interface inspired by breast cancer awareness themes.
High-Performance Model: Powered by an ANN trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset, ensuring robust and accurate predictions.
Key Features:
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for intuitive and seamless interaction.
Model Accuracy: Delivers an accuracy rate of 96.74%.
Awareness-Focused Design: Incorporates visuals and themes to support breast cancer awareness initiatives.
